freepbx-trunk-balancing
=======================

The FreePBX Trunk Balancing module can be used to limit usage of FreePBX trunks after defined thresholds
have been exceeded or to balance usage over multiple trunks. This module is used primarily to help users
create a "least-cost" route environment. It can also balance the load on multiple outbound trunk by applying
a ratio factor.
